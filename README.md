ABSTRACT
•	Data Analysis is done on ELITE SPORTS CARS Dataset.
•	It has columns brand name, fuel efficiency, price, year, mileage, engine Size and lot more.
•	Clustering, Regression, Correlation map, Visualization are done on this dataset and achieved required output.
•	Supervised Learning – Logistic regression is used to predict whether a car is “new” or “used” based on Precision, recall, f1 score, support .
•	Unsupervised Learning – K means Clustering, clustering is done based on numerical features like price, year, and mileage, and engine, size.
•	Cluster Visualization with PCA is done .this 2d scatter plot helps to visualize how data points group together in 2D space.
•	Categorical Data is encoded.
•	Correlation map for showing correlation values between numeric columns.
